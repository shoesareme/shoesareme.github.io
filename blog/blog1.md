# Blog 1 - About Me (9/13/2025)

Hey! My name is Jason. As of writing this, I am a high school student at TJHSST. I will be graduating in 2027.

## My Interests

I'm mainly interested in mathematical logic, a fairly niche field but honestly really really cool. I'm still learning a lot so expect me to make a lot of inaccuracies (I am still a high schooler after all!). But truly, this field is a blast to explore. I started this blog mainly for myself to record down all the cool things I encounter along the way.
