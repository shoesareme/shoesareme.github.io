# In Regards to My Previous Website (9/13/2025)

I don't think a single person ever came across it, which makes me sleep easy. Truly, I had no idea what I was doing back then. Perhaps that is a sign that I grew a lot both as a person and a math enthusiast. But, I believe I should at least acknowledge it. Perhaps one day I'll grow more as a person and realize that nobody cares what I write so I shouldn't be afraid to post those old writings (after all, I'll probably cringe upon this in about a year), but for now I'll occasionally post highlights.

The website itself existed for three years, and the blog I started on there existed since 11/27/2024 and I last updated it 7/21/2025. I talked about the same things I planned to talk about here. 

I suppose the most interesting blog I wrote was one where I asked GPT to create it's own mathematical foundation. It ended up being pretty weak and had a lot of flaws (as expected, I was using the free version), but it was interesting nonetheless. Again, perhaps I will post this in full in the future.
