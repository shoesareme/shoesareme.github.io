This will host a lot of my archived stuff, including bits and pieces of my old website.

### Blog 4 - AI Systems of Mathematics (12/28/2024 - 6/7/2025)

In this blog, I attempted to ask ChatGPT to create its own formalization/foundation of mathematics. The results are actually really interesting! I may continue this in the future elsewhere. If I do, I'll link it here.

### Blog 6 - String Mathematical Foundation (3/7/2025)

In this blog, I inquired about strings as serving a logical foundation. At the time, I was not aware of mathematical concepts such as the free monoid $$\Sigma^{*}$$ or such, and this is apparent in the blog. Furthermore, the definitions and stuff made in here are really artificial. Regardless, I think it is important to preserve such "baby-steps" in one's career. I might also revist this one to show the proof system strength.
