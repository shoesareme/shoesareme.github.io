# About Me

> under construction

Hi! I'm Jason Zhang. I'm currently in High School (TJHSST Class of 2027), so expect me to get everything wrong! My main interests are mathematical logic (set theory, model theory, etc.) and theoretical computer science (computability theory, algorithms, automated reasoning/ML, etc.). I'm starting to explore fields such as category theory and type theory.

## Selected Works

Here are some of my best works!

### Infinitary Combinatorics (Lecture)

The materials found here were for a guest lecture at a TJVMT SARML session on 8/7/2025. The material here is heavily oversimplified/introductory as such.
