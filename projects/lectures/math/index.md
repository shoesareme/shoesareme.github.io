# Math Lectures

The following is a collection of lectures that I've written concerning math-related topics.

## Infinitary Combinatorics (8/7/2025)

The materials found here were for a guest lecture at a TJVMT SARML session. As such, the materials found within this lecture feature HEAVY oversimplification to make it more understandable for a high school student. Therefore, it is not intended as a reliable source for serious study.

## Shorts and Lecture Notes

These comprise very short one-off lectures that were written purely for fun. Alternatively, there are also notes that I've written for studying and classes.

### Multivariable Calculus Chapter 16 Notes (Iteration 1, Ongoing)

This was a unit of multivariable calculus concerning double and triple integrals. As of writing this, the unit is ongoing so the ntoes are incomplete. This is what I have temporarily:

### Multivariable Calculus Chain Rule (9/25/2025)

I wrote this to help my friends (and myself) study for a test.
